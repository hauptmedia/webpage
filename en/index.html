            Camunda has developed a very good open source process engine over many years with the Camunda 7 Community Edition. Camunda 7 could be easily integrated into existing Spring Boot and other Java applications, or connected as a lightweight external engine. In the Java world and beyond, the name Camunda has enjoyed a high reputation for years. Unfortunately, however, the Camunda 7 Community Edition will discontinued in October 2025. There will be no more support or further development for it. The Community Edition will no longer receive any maintenance.
            <br/><br/>
            That is why we have forked the project under the new name Operaton.
            <br/><br/>
            The artefacts for the fork are available at Maven Central Operaton 1.0.0-Beta. The code is on <a href="https://github.com/operaton" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. We invite you to test the project and give us feedback. To do so, you can create issues in the repository.
            <br/><br/>
            There will be no more closed source components. We want to create complete technical transparency in the engine. We want to build a new community around Operaton and invite you to join.
            <br/><br/>
            However, Operaton should not be left in the past. In addition to the existing features, we have created a roadmap that describes how we, together with the community, can make Operaton a modern engine. You can find more information under <a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            Who is behind Operaton?
            <br/><br/>
            We are Tim Zöller, Andreas Klein and Andreas Zill. Over the past few years, we have gained a lot of experience with processes and various process engines. We all work professionally in process development and consulting.
            <br/><br/>
            We are at the beginning of a new journey and look forward to your support and cooperation. Be it in the exchange of ideas or in development. For this purpose, we have set up a <a href="https://forum.operaton.org" target="_blank">Forum</a> where you can get in touch with us and participate in the project.
            <br/><br/>
            Let's make the world of processes a little more open and free!
            <br/><br/>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: What is the correct capitalization for the project name: "Operaton" or "OPERATON"?</strong><br/>
            A: The correct capitalization is "Operaton." While some early communications used the all-uppercase "OPERATON," this led to inconsistencies. The trademark is registered as "Operaton," and the community has agreed to use this capitalization consistently to avoid confusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: What is the current status of establishing a legal entity for Operaton, and can companies become members?</strong><br/>
            A: Operaton aims to become a Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) project managed by a community-driven legal entity, such as a foundation or a registered association ("eingetragener Verein") within the EU. This entity will own the project's assets, including trademarks and domain names, ensuring community control. Companies are welcome to join the association as members, contributing to and supporting the project's development.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: Why is Operaton registered as a trademark, and what is the plan for its ownership?</strong><br/>
            A: The trademark exists to protect the Operaton brand and ensure its proper use, preventing misuse or confusion in the community and the marketplace. Currently, the trademark is held by a temporary entity. However, once the Operaton association is formally established, ownership of the trademark will be transferred to the association. This ensures that the trademark is controlled by the community-driven organization, aligning with Operaton’s principles of transparency, collaboration, and open governance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: What strategies are in place to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Operaton project?</strong><br/>
            A: The Operaton community is actively discussing various strategies to ensure the project's longevity. These include establishing a community-driven legal entity to manage assets, encouraging both individual and corporate contributions, and fostering an inclusive environment for collaboration. By implementing these measures, Operaton aims to build a resilient and sustainable project.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: How can community members contribute to Operaton's presence at conferences in 2025?</strong><br/>
            A: Community involvement is crucial for Operaton's representation at conferences. Members are encouraged to submit talk proposals, organize workshops, or participate in events to showcase Operaton's initiatives. Engaging in these activities helps raise awareness and fosters collaboration within the tech community.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: How can companies participate and contribute to the Operaton project?</strong><br/>
            A: Companies are welcome to actively engage with the Operaton project in several ways. They can become members of the planned Operaton association, contributing to its governance and decision-making processes. Companies can also provide financial support, sponsor development efforts, or contribute code and expertise to the project. By participating, companies not only help shape the project's future but also gain the opportunity to align their interests with a thriving open-source community, fostering innovation and collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: Why doesn't Operaton simply clone existing repositories instead of changing the namespace, and what challenges are associated with this approach?</strong><br/>
            A: While cloning existing repositories might seem straightforward, Operaton faces both legal and technical challenges with this method. Legally, certain constraints necessitate changes beyond mere cloning. Technically, platforms like Maven Central prohibit publishing packages outside one's designated namespace. To address these issues and facilitate a smooth transition, Operaton is developing OpenRewrite scripts to assist users in migrating to the new namespace.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: How is Operaton managing backports?</strong><br/>
            A: The backporting process is aligned with the end-of-life (EOL) date for Camunda 7 version 7.24, which is October 2025. Until then, all valuable commits will be systematically reviewed and backported to ensure compatibility and continuity. Operaton has streamlined this effort by automating much of the process, ensuring a thorough and efficient approach to incorporating all relevant updates. This ensures that the project remains up-to-date and reliable for its users.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: What is the planned scope for Operaton version 1.0.0, and how is the development team approaching its release?</strong><br/>
            A: We are committed to ensuring that version 1.0.0 is robust and fully featured. To achieve this, we are focusing on comprehensive documentation and thorough testing. The team is open to releasing multiple beta versions to address any issues and incorporate feedback. Contributors are encouraged to assist, particularly with build-related issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: What is Operaton's policy regarding support for legacy Java EE and older versions of Spring frameworks?</strong><br/>
            A: Operaton has decided to discontinue support for legacy Java EE, Spring 5, and Spring Boot 2 to focus on modern,
            more secure, and efficient technologies. This decision aligns with industry trends and allows the project to leverage
            the latest features and improvements in newer versions of these frameworks. Users are encouraged to migrate their
            applications to supported versions to ensure compatibility and receive ongoing support.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: How does Operaton plan to manage community-contributed plugins, such as the Keycloak Identity Provider Plugin?</strong><br/>
            A: Operaton encourages community contributions and is considering a structured approach to managing plugins.
            Widely used plugins, like the Keycloak Identity Provider Plugin, will be integrated into the main Operaton GitHub
            organization to ensure long-term maintenance and alignment with the project's standards. This approach will involve
            evaluating each plugin on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as popularity and relevance. Additionally,
            creating a curated list of available plugins, possibly in an "Awesome Operaton" repository, has been proposed to help users discover and utilize community-supported extensions.
